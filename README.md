This is a MERN stack token authenticated messaging app to allow users to add other users as friends, build a user profile, and communicate with each other. This app is for people who want to be able to communicate with their friends and family but donâ€™t have a phone or an active phone number. The niche this app exists to fill is already filled by aspects of other services, like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, etc. However, building this myself from scratch will be an excellent showcase in server API development, database architecture and management, user interface and user experience understanding, as well as development related to multiple iterations of an application existing, functioning, and communicating with each other at the same time through a cloud-hosted database.
